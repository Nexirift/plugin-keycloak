# plugin-keycloak

A basic [GraphQL Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga) plugin that
adds functionality to authenticate users using the
[Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) service.

## Deprecation Notice

As of the 9th of April 2024,
[plugin-keycloak](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-keycloak) has been
deprecated, effective immediately. If you wish to use this package, please
switch to [plugin-oidc](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-oidc) as that will be
our new maintained version. The new plugin will have support for OpenID Connect
compatible clients meaning that you can use other services like
[Authentik](https://goauthentik.io).

## How does it work?

This plugin checks an access token which is a `Bearer` token on the
`Authentication` header with the Keycloak server to verify if it's valid.
Additionally, it passes back the response info, which includes information like
the `preferred_username`, this can then be used in the GraphQL Yoga server to
identify users.

## BREAKING CHANGES

Starting from
[v1.1.5](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-keycloak/releases/tag/1.1.5), we
have removed the dependency of `keycloak-backend`. In addition, we have changed
`ITokenContent` to `KeycloakToken`, please update these in your code. You can
also see this
[commit](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-keycloak-example/commit/6dcf3c9dc93351006b63005f7e398cc72fa84522)
for changes.

## Example

Please see [here](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-keycloak-example) for an
example of how to use the project.

## Disclaimer

We are working on trying to stop depending on so many dependencies. As part of
this, we have copied some code from the keycloak-backend library. This project,
at the time of writing, is using the MIT license. The files that were took were:

-   `Token.ts` -> `token.ts`
-   `Keycloak.ts` -> `keycloak.ts`
-   `Jwt.ts` -> `jwt.ts`

We plan to adapt these files more as we change around our codebase. For example,
the new scopes feature that was mentioned in issue
[#2](https://github.com/Nexirift/plugin-keycloak/issues/2).

## Credits

Disclaimer: This plugin was based off of the plugin-jwt source code.
